cfdg-js is a JavaScript implementation of Chris Coyne's "Context Free
Design Grammar".

It's open source, under the MIT License (enclosed).

I'm currently resuscitating it.  It doesn't have a clear API, it
doesn't have any specs, and some parts don't work.  I haven't yet
inventoried what does and doesn't.
