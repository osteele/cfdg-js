Work with Margaret:
- positioning triangle

Basic functionality:

Infinity:

- loop detection

Web:

- PDF

Optimize:
- combine paths
- only use circles at large sizes
- [[x,y]] vs. [{x: x, y: y}] vs. [x,y]
- always convert to float
- inline setAttribute

- [length] instead of push

Polish:
- inline syntax errors
- About
- better circles (cf. builtin)

Frills:
