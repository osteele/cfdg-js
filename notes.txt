Agenda:
- set bounds
- fix rotation

Basic functionality:

Infinity:
- size cut-off
- loop detection

Web:
- save
- view gallery
- email
- share
- PDF

Polish:
- add colors
- position triangle
- inline syntax errors
- About
- better circles (cf. builtin)

Frills:
- auto-color

Literacy:
- move boundary updating, if it's not too expensive
- clean up the sx sy mess
- clean up the view resizing mess

Optimize:
- combine paths
- only use circles at large sizes
- [[x,y]] vs. [{x: x, y: y}] vs. [x,y]
- always convert to float
- inline setAttribute
- build a Transform for each shape
- [length] instead of push
